# Titanic Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to explore patterns in passenger survival based on features like age, gender, class, and more. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning models to predict survival outcomes. The goal is to uncover insights into the factors that influenced survival rates and build predictive models.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Titanic dataset, commonly available from sources like Kaggle. It contains information about passengers, including:
- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- **Name**, **Sex**, **Age**, **SibSp**, **Parch**, **Ticket**, **Fare**, **Cabin**, **Embarked**: Other passenger attributes

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- jupyter (optional, for running notebooks)

Install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Saiconsr/Titanic-Analysis.git
   cd Titanic-Analysis
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. (Optional) Download the Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and place `train.csv` and `test.csv` in the `data/` folder.

## Usage
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Open `notebooks/Titanic_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to explore the dataset, visualize survival patterns, and analyze feature correlations.
   - Run the notebook cells to generate plots and insights.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Use `scripts/preprocessing.py` to clean the dataset, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables.

3. **Modeling**:
   - Run `scripts/model.py` to train machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) and evaluate their performance.

Example command to run preprocessing:
```bash
python scripts/preprocessing.py
```

## Analysis Highlights
- **EDA**: Visualizations of survival rates by gender, class, and age; handling of missing values in `Age` and `Cabin`.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created features like family size (`SibSp + Parch`) and title extracted from `Name`.
- **Modeling**: Trained models to predict survival, with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall reported.

## Results
- Key insights: Women and higher-class passengers had higher survival rates.
- Model performance: (Example) Random Forest achieved ~80% accuracy on the test set.
